### Circuit breaker pattern

> A circuit breaker is an electrical device that safeguards the electric devices. Those devices are connected to the same power input. so the circuit breaker is situated at the input of power to a building. the circuit breaker exactly acts as the same as a fuse (a device that when there is an abnormal flow on Voltage, breaks the network because, for example, high/low voltage may damage your devices). The difference between a circuit breaker and a fuse is that a circuit breaker can be reset, manually or automatically.

In this repo, I Implemented the circuit breaker pattern using a decorator pattern and Also the latest version of the Polly nuget package. If you like to read my full article on this concept please visit the link below:
